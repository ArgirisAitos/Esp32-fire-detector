# ðŸ”¥ IoT Fire Detection System

---

This project implements a **Smart IoT Fire Detection System** using an **ESP32 microcontroller**. It reads data from environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, smoke, flame) and sends it to an **MQTT broker**. The data is stored in **InfluxDB** and visualized in real time with **Grafana**. All services are containerized using **Docker Compose**.
